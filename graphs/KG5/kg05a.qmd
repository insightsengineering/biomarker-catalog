## Plot

Alternatively we can also use the `cut()` function to cut the continuous biomarker variable `BMRKR1` into a factor with two levels `BMRKR1_CAT`, and then create its interaction with the treatment arm variable, to create effectively the same graphical comparison.

```{r}
adtte2 <- adtte %>%
  mutate(
    BMRKR1_CAT = cut(BMRKR1, c(0, 5, 22)),
    ARM_BMRKR1 = interaction(ARM_BIN, BMRKR1_CAT)
  )

g_km(
  df = adtte2,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = TRUE,
  col = c("red", "blue", "red", "blue"),
  lty = c(1, 1, 2, 2)
)
```
