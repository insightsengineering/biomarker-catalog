## Plot

For reordering or renaming we can just modify the levels of the corresponding factors of the treatment arm and biomarker variables, and pass the result to `g_km()` as before.

```{r}
adtte_mod <- adtte %>%
  mutate(
    ARM_BMRKR2 = fct_collapse_only(
      ARM_BMRKR2,
      TRT.Low = "TRT.Low",
      TRT.High = "TRT.High",
      CTRL.Low = "CTRL.Low",
      CTRL.High = "CTRL.High"
    )
  )

g_km(
  df = adtte_mod,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = FALSE,
  col = c("red", "blue", "red", "blue"),
  lty = c(1, 1, 2, 2)
)
```
