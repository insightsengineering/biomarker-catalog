## Plot

It is also possible to join and select subgroup categories manually using the `groups_lists` argument, as follows.
Here we join the low and medium levels of `BMRKR2` into a category `one` and compare with the high level labeled as category `two`.

```{r, fig.width = 15}
df <- extract_survival_biomarkers(
  variables = list(
    tte = "AVAL",
    is_event = "is_event",
    biomarkers = c("BMRKR1", "AGE"),
    covariates = "SEX",
    subgroups = "BMRKR2"
  ),
  data = adtte_f,
  groups_list = list(
    BMRKR2 = list(
      one = c("LOW", "MEDIUM"),
      two = "HIGH"
    )
  )
)

result <- tabulate_survival_biomarkers(
  df = df,
  vars = c("n_tot_events", "n_tot", "median", "hr", "ci"),
  time_unit = adtte_f$AVALU[1]
)
g_forest(result, xlim = c(0.7, 1.4))
```
