## Plot

We can filter the dataset further for the biomarker evaluable population using the corresponding flag variable, here `BEP01FL`:

```{r}
adtte_arm_bep <- adtte_arm %>%
  filter(BEP01FL == "Y")
```

Afterwards we can plot the basic KM graph, just using the further filtered dataset `adtte_bep`.
Here we annotate the plot with median survival time, but could suppress it with `annot_surv_med = FALSE`.

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
g_km(
  df = adtte_arm_bep,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = TRUE,
  rel_height_plot = 0.85
)
```
