## Plot

The line color and line type in the plot can be customized using the `col` and `lty` arguments of `g_km()`, respectively.
Note that the order of the levels of the treatment arm factor variable is matched with the order of the colors.

```{r}
g_km(
  df = adtte,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = TRUE,
  col = c("purple", "orange", "red"),
  lty = 5
)
```
