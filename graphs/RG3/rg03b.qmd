## Plot

In this example we compare the responses across treatment arms between the BEP and the full population using the option `position = "stack"` in the `geom_bar()` layer to display counts instead of percentages.

```{r}
graph <- ggplot(adrs, aes(BMEASIFL, fill = AVALC_BIN, by = BMEASIFL)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = NULL) +
  xlab(NULL) +
  geom_text(stat = "count", aes(label = after_stat(count)), position = position_stack(.5), colour = "white") +
  facet_grid(BEP01FL ~ ARM_BIN, margins = TRUE)

graph
```
