## Plot

The advantage of using the `cut()` function is that it is sufficient to add additional cutoffs in order to obtain more than two bins for the cut version of the continuous biomarker variable.
Again we can check the order of the factor levels to determine the `col` and `lty` arguments for `g_km()`.
Here we want to always use red for the control and blue for the treatment arm, and then vary the line type for the different biomarker bins.

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10}
adtte3 <- adtte %>%
  mutate(
    BMRKR1_CAT = cut(BMRKR1, c(0, 5, 10, 22)),
    ARM_BMRKR1 = interaction(ARM_BIN, BMRKR1_CAT)
  )
levels(adtte3$ARM_BMRKR1)

g_km(
  df = adtte3,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = TRUE,
  col = c("red", "blue", "red", "blue", "red", "blue"),
  lty = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)
)
```
