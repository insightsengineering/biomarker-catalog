## Plot

We can produce the basic graph using the `g_km()` function from `tern`.

```{r}
g_km(
  df = adtte,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = FALSE,
  col = c("red", "blue", "red", "blue"),
  lty = c(1, 1, 2, 2)
)
```

We can also choose to annotate the plot with the median survival time for each of the treatment arms using the `annot_surv_med = TRUE` option.

```{r}
g_km(
  df = adtte,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = TRUE,
  col = c("red", "blue", "red", "blue"),
  lty = c(1, 1, 2, 2)
)
```
