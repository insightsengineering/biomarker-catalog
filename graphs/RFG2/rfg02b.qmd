## Plot

It is also possible to join and select subgroup categories manually using the `groups_lists` argument, as follows.

```{r, fig.width = 15}
df <- extract_rsp_biomarkers(
  variables = list(
    rsp = "COMPRESP",
    biomarkers = c("BMRKR1", "AGE"),
    covariates = "SEX",
    subgroups = "BMRKR2"
  ),
  data = adrs_f,
  groups_list = list(
    BMRKR2 = list(
      one = c("LOW", "MEDIUM"),
      two = "HIGH"
    )
  )
)

result <- tabulate_rsp_biomarkers(df, vars = c("n_tot", "n_rsp", "prop", "or", "ci"))
g_forest(result, xlim = c(0.7, 1.4))
```
