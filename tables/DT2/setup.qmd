## Setup

The tables below compare the biomarker evaluable population (BEP, below in the table "BEP Yes") with the remainder non-BEP ("BEP No") within each treatment arm with regards to selected demographic variables.

We will use the `synthetic_cdisc_data$adsl` data set from the `scda` package to illustrate the tables.

In order to compare the BEP with the non-BEP, we only need to split columns on the BEP flag variable `BEP01FL` that categorises the evaluable and non evaluable subgroups.
For readability in the tables, we define a separate label variable `BEP_label` below which is parallel to the original flag variable.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tern)
library(dplyr)

adsl <- scda::synthetic_cdisc_data("rcd_2022_06_27")$adsl %>%
  df_explicit_na() %>%
  mutate(
    BEP_label = case_when(
      BEP01FL == "Y" ~ "BEP Yes",
      BEP01FL == "N" ~ "BEP No"
    )
  )
```

This can then be used by the `rtables` layout function `split_cols_by()` below.
