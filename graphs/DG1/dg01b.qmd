## Plot

Below example shows histograms for the `BMRKR1` variable by treatment `ARM`.
Including a statistics table in this graph works in the same way as we did above for DG1A.

```{r}
graph <- ggplot(adsl, aes(BMRKR1)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), bins = 30) +
  geom_density(aes(y = after_stat(density))) +
  facet_grid(ARM ~ .)

graph
```
