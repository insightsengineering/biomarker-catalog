## Plot

For the calculations, we start by getting the levels from `BMRKR1_BIN` which saves us typing them manually in the `groups_lists` definition.
This definition is required here so that we can have overlapping subgroups.

```{r}
BMRKR1_BIN_levels <- levels(adtte$BMRKR1_BIN)

tbl <- extract_survival_subgroups(
  variables = list(
    tte = "AVAL",
    is_event = "is_event",
    arm = "ARM_BIN",
    subgroups = c("BEP01FL", "BMRKR1_BIN")
  ),
  label_all = "ITT",
  groups_lists = list(
    BMRKR1_BIN = list(
      "(25%,100%]" = BMRKR1_BIN_levels[2:4],
      "(50%,100%]" = BMRKR1_BIN_levels[3:4],
      "(75%,100%]" = BMRKR1_BIN_levels[4]
    )
  ),
  data = adtte
)

result <- basic_table() %>%
  tabulate_survival_subgroups(
    df = tbl,
    vars = c("n_tot_events", "n", "n_events", "median", "hr", "ci"),
    time_unit = adtte$AVALU[1]
  )
```

We can now produce the forest plot using the `g_forest()` function from `tern` based on this `result` table.

```{r, fig.width = 15}
g_forest(result)
```
