## Plot

We can customize the color and line type used in the graph with the `col` and `lty` arguments of `g_km()`.
We can first check the level order of the `ARM_BMRKR2` factor variable to know which color and line type order we need.

```{r}
levels(adtte$ARM_BMRKR2)
g_km(
  df = adtte,
  variables = variables,
  annot_surv_med = TRUE,
  col = c("green", "orange", "green", "orange"),
  lty = c(5, 5, 3, 3)
)
```
