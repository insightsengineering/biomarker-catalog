## Setup

The tables below compare the overall population ("All") with the biomarker evaluable population ("BEP") with regards to selected demographic variables.

We will use the `synthetic_cdisc_data$adsl` data set from the `scda` package to illustrate the tables.
We add a second artificial BEP flag variable `BEP02FL`.

In order to compare All with BEP, we need to define a list `bep_groups` defining these two groups.
The reason is that these two groups are overlapping (BEP is a subset of All).
Here, we refer in the list elements to the levels `Y` and `N` of the biomarker population flag variable `BEP01FL` from `adsl` which we will use below:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tern)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(123)
adsl <- scda::synthetic_cdisc_data("rcd_2022_06_27")$adsl %>%
  df_explicit_na() %>%
  mutate(BEP02FL = factor(sample(c("Y", "N"), size = n(), replace = TRUE)))

bep_groups <- list(
  "All" = c("Y", "N"),
  "BEP" = "Y"
)
```

This can then be used by the `tern` layout function `split_cols_by_groups()` below.
