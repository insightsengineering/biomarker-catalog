## Plot

In this example we compare the responses across subgroups of the BEP defined by the levels of a categorical biomarker, and overall BEP, again using the `facet_grid()` layer with the option `margins = TRUE`.
We do need to filter first on the BEP flag to restrict the data to the BEP.

```{r}
adrs_bep <- adrs %>%
  filter(BEP01FL == "Y")

graph <- ggplot(adrs_bep, aes(BMEASIFL, fill = AVALC_BIN, by = BMEASIFL)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent,
    name = "Proportion %"
  ) +
  geom_text(stat = "prop", position = position_fill(.5), colour = "white") +
  facet_grid(BMRKR2 ~ ARM_BIN, margins = TRUE)

graph
```
