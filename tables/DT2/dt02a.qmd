## Table

The demographics table DT2A splits the columns by treatment arm and by BEP vs. non-BEP, summarizes selected demographic variables in the rows and performs tests to compare demographic variables between Non-BEP vs. BEP population.
Note that p-values can be `NA` when the test could not be performed due to row counts being all zero, e.g.

```{r}
lyt <- basic_table() %>%
  split_cols_by("ARM") %>%
  add_colcounts() %>%
  split_cols_by("BEP01FL", labels_var = "BEP_label", ref_group = "Y") %>%
  compare_vars(c("AGE", "SEX"))

build_table(lyt, adsl)
```
