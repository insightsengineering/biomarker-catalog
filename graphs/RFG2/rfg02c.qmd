## Plot

Finally we can also specify stratification variables with the `strat` variable element, which leads to the use of conditional logistic regression models.

```{r, fig.width = 15}
df <- extract_rsp_biomarkers(
  variables = list(
    rsp = "COMPRESP",
    biomarkers = c("BMRKR1", "AGE"),
    covariates = "SEX",
    subgroups = "BMRKR2",
    strat = c("STRATA1", "STRATA2")
  ),
  data = adrs_f
)

result <- tabulate_rsp_biomarkers(df, vars = c("n_tot", "n_rsp", "prop", "or", "ci"))
g_forest(result, xlim = c(0.7, 1.4))
```
